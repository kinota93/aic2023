TypeScript

Developed and maintained by Microsoft, `TypeScript` is an object-oriented, open-source programming language. It’s a superset of JavaScript, containing optional typing. Also, it compiles to plain JavaScript.

In a nutshell, TypeScript is a statically compiled programming language for writing clear and concise JavaScript code. It’s fulfilling the same purpose as JavaScript and can be used for both client-side and server-side applications. In addition, the libraries of JavaScript are also compatible with TypeScript.

`TypeScript` is a modern-age language – a syntactical superset of JavaScript, whereas `JavaScript` is a scripting language – a subset of TypeScript.

`TypeScript` and `JavaScript` are two complementary technologies that are driving both front-end and back-end development. 

JavaScript lacks a `type system`. In JavaScript, variables can haphazardly change form, while TypeScript in `strict mode` forbids this. This makes TypeScript easier to manage and maintain, especially with a large codebase.
